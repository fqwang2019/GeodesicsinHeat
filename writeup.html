<h3>Summary of Contributions</h3>


<p>I realized the parallel implementation of the Geodesics in Heat Method taking advantages of both CPU(using OpenMP) and GPU(using OpenGL) on Mac, achieving a 16% speed up. Techniques like SIMD, atomic operations, exclusive-scan, lock and dense matrix have been attempted and carefully chosen.

</h3>
<p>The whole process of the algorithm could be divided into the following 5 parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read information from input files</li>
  <li>Build up the information needed for the heat method</li>
  <li>Executing the kernel functions</li>
  <li>Writing results to output files</li>
  <li>Comparing with reference distances</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have the HSL_MA87 library to parallel the hmTriDistanceUpdate()(kernel function), my main goal is to speed up the process of preparing the matrixes for the kernel functions. That is, to parallel the step2 Build-up-information part.

<p>I worked on Intel Core I7 and AMD Radeon R9, which provide CPU(using OpenMP) and GPU(using OpenGL) platforms respectively. Both OpenMP and OpenGL have a large range of hardwares to work on, making the source code easy to transplant on other machines.
</p>
<p>OpenMP and OpenGL have their own characteristics, of which I need to take into consideration when choosing the right one to speed up a specific point.
